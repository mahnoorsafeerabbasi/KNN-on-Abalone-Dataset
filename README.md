# KNN-on-Abalone-Dataset
This repository provides an implementation of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Abalone dataset consists of measurements of physical characteristics of abalone, a type of shellfish, and the goal is to predict their age based on these attributes.
